        <p>I just finished Week 0 of Harvard CS50 2026. This week was an introduction to computer science and computational thinking. Some of the topics that were covered included how numbers, text, images, music, and video are understood and represented by computers. We also learned about programming concepts such as functions, conditionals, loops, and variables. The beginning of the video lecture also talked about AI and how it is changing how programming is done. The takeaway was that AI can help, but it is important to know the fundamentals.</p>
        
        <p>The problem set for this week was to create a Scratch project (I have linked mine). This was not that hard, but still took me a few hours to finish. I feel like it was a good introduction to programming. As of now, I am not sure how similar this will be to actual programming. My biggest advice is that if the code (blocks) are not acting in the manner you want, don't think you can't do it and give up. Take a break, try moving things around, and start with small things such as adding the background and controls before adding too much. For me, it was the small things that took the longest and were the most tedious.</p>
