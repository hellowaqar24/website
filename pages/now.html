    <p>This is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank" style="color: var(--accent); text-decoration: underline;">now page</a>, inspired by Derek Sivers. It's a snapshot of what I'm focused on at this point in my life.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Current Focus:</strong> My main goal for 2026 is to <a href="#blog" style="color: var(--accent); text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--accent);"><span class="highlight">conquer procrastination</span></a>.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Currently Learning:</strong> Working on CS50's Introduction to Computer Science and working through the book Python Crash Course: A Hands-on, Project-based Introduction to Programming. Also relearning algebra through calculus in order to be able to self-study and teach myself higher mathematics.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Reading:</strong> Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software by Charles Petzold, Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, and Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-top: 40px; color: var(--text-dim); font-size: 14px;">This page is a living document. I'll update it regularly to reflect my current priorities and focus areas.
