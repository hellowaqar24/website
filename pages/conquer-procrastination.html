    <h2>Conquer Procrastination</h2>
    <div class="post-date">January 2026</div>
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Why did I create this website? The answer is simple: to conquer procrastination. But why now? As I'm writing this is the beginning of a new year (2026), as millions set goals for the new year so I decided to join in. The goal is simple: conquer procrastinating. There's so many things I want to learn and experience. From learning how to code, to learning how to rock climb, traveling the world and everything in between.</p>
        
        <p>I once came across a saying that resonated with me: "If I could have any superpower, it would be the ability to make things easier to learn the longer I procrastinate on them." Procrastination is an almost universal challenge, a defining aspect of the human condition.</p>
        
        <p>This website is where I will document my victory against procrastination. This is a journey for me, I'm not expecting it to be easy. Whether it's a straight line to success or a maze with lessons in disguise, both outcomes are welcomed.</p>
        
        <p>I believe curiosity is essential for everything. Having the ability to be curious is important. The ability to be amazed by everything and wanting to know everything about everything. This might seem random, but nearly all of the things I want to do require learning new skills. Don't give up.</p>
        
        <p><strong>BTW</strong> How can you be bored? There are so many things to see, explore, discover, and experience—enough to fill multiple lifetimes—and we only have one.</p>
